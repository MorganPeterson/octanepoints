The scoring configuration uses TOML format. The config file should be named `config.toml`Â and placed in the directory you are running the application in. A configuration file
is included in the repo.

```toml
cg = 7
url = "https://rallysimfans.hu/rbr/csv_export_results.php?rally_id=%d&cg=%d"
points = [32, 28, 25, 22, 20, 18, 16, 14, 12, 11, 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1]
headers = "pos,driver,points"
```

## Examples
